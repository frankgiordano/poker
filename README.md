# poker
A simple poker game simulation.

This was one of my early C++ programs I have written. I decided to post on github and update the code to build successfully on modern
c++ compiler in this case MS Visual Studio Express. I have also polished the code and fixed an issue with the input buffer that was there
for a long time. 

Enjoy.
